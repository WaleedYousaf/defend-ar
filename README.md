Introduction:
-------------
This project is an augmented reality game, Defend AR. It is based on the popular tower defense 
game but it includes the augmented reality aspect. In the game, the userâ€™s primary goal 
will be to defend the hideout of the main character. The system will target the cards and augment 
objects accordingly, to be seen through the mobile screen. The enemies will be spawning from a 
single instantiation marker towards the hideout using intelligent path finding and collision 
avoidance. The system will allow user to defend the hideout using weapons. The range of each 
weapon, the trajectory of attacks, and the impact will be different for every weapon. User will 
also be able to upgrade and purchase better weapons from the store as the levels progress.

While defending the tower from enemies, the range of each weapon, the trajectory of attacks, and 
the impact will be different for every weapon. Because the game is physics based, the impact of attacks on both 
sides will be shown. The enemies will progressively get better as levels progress. Whatever is 
happening in the game, the system will allow the user to view it in 3D as the user tilts and rotates 
phone to enhance AR experience.
